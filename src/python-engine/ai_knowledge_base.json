For Manufacturing units, Working Capital component should not be more than 40% of the project cost and for units under Service/Trading sector, the Working Capital shall not be more than 60% of the project cost.

Bankers Review Meetings PMEGP is a Bank driven scheme, and the final sanction of project and release of loan is done at the level of concerned Bank. It is therefore imperative that KVIC, KVIBs, DICs and other IAs interact regularly with the higher officials of Bankers at District/ State/National level to ensure that the bottlenecks in implementation, if any, are resolved, outcomes are effectively achieved, and targets are met. Bankers Review Meeting at following levels shall be organized as below: (i) State Level Bankers Meeting: This will be organized by State Office and Divisional Office of KVIC jointly with KVIB, DIC, and other concerned IAs.
